	// Purpose:the IsItInList function takes employee object and, using a for loop, it checks if the 
	//emeployee is already in the employee list vector and returnes the index of it if it finds it
	//other wise it will return -1
	// input: takes employee object. 
	// output:  returnes an int, the index of that employee if it exists, and -1 if it doesn't .

	// Purpose: get the employee list vector size
	// Input: nothing
	// output: size of the vector of employee list

	//purpose: used in a function if the string id or name did not match or was inputted incorectly
	//input : string str by reference so that the string outside is changed too
